        <h1> Don't be afraid to be &lt; then a 100% success &amp; &gt; more:</h1>

        <p>
            &quot; it is not the critic who ounts; not  the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of the deeds could have done them better. the cedit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and seet and blood, who strives valianatly;who errs, who comes short again and again, bacuase there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actualy strive to d the deeds, who knows great enthuasism the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph f high achievement and who at the worst,if fails at least while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory &nbsp; nor&nbsp; defeat.&quot;
